# fsp-usb

> Custom Nintendo Switch service to mount and access USB drives

## Information

This sysmodule was going to be part of Atmosphere, but due to lack of motivation I stopped working on it for several months.

This is an attempt to port the old code and to fix possible bugs it had, and is still a work-in-progress.

## Service

This hosts a service named `fsp-usb`, whose interfaces behave almost like `fsp-srv`'s file system interfaces.
